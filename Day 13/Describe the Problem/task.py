# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# the loop is iterating from 1 to 19
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When the loop reaches 20, but it will never reach because it goes up to 19
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# That it will reach 20
